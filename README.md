# Digit Recognizer using CNN (MNIST)

A deep learning project that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using an advanced Convolutional Neural Network built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Dataset
- MNIST handwritten digits dataset
- 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images
- Image size: 28×28 grayscale

## Model
- 3 Convolutional layers + Batch Normalization
- MaxPooling & Dropout for regularization
- Softmax output layer

## Results
- Test Accuracy: ~99%
- Confusion Matrix and sample predictions included

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
